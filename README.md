# MathsAnalysis
Some mathematical analysis which I did spordaically over the last two years.

Originally intended for the Spirit of Ramunajan math competition (though I've made updates since then)
Unfortunately, I wasn't selected.
(and to be transparent, the members had doubts about my suitability itself, which may mean that my work could be very poor. Just keep that in mind)
